		<h2>William Herkewitz</h2>

		<p><em>Repitch!</em>: <strong>Personal Climate Change</strong> &mdash; I'd like to cull the monthly records for high and low temperatures from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Wunderground</a> and for every city in the United States going back to 2000. I'd map this 'extreme weather' data, to see which states, counties, and cities have seen the most high and low temperature records across the country. I'd also like this project to provide the underlay to a question: Do hometown extreme temperature events effect opinion on climate change?
