		<h2>Director Demands Investigation</h2>

		<h4 class="adapted">Adapted from The Onion</h4>

		<p>LANGLEY &mdash; A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

		<p>According to the report, sections of the documents &mdash; "almost invariably the most crucial passages" &mdash; are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

		<p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>the Cold War</li>
		<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
		<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
		</ul>
